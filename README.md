#Atomic Words

---
###Description:
I recently took a one-off class at Columbia on image processing.
The class explored the basics through the investigation of
the problem of counting coins in a picture using the [Hough transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform).
This is my implementation of the solution in Java.

###Goals:
####Completed:
* README


####Short Term Plans:
* Class that takes an image and outputs a two dimensional array of ints representing the edges of the picture using the [Sobel operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
* Interface to represent an accumulator
* Implementation of that interface for circles
* Main class to handle image loading and saving and calling other classes

####Long Term Plans:
* Guess at value from relative radii of circles
* GUI
